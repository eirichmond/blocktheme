A full site editing theme. No code version.

A simple block theme starter kit for developers, this is not a theme to use, its meant to be a starter theme to build on to create your own block based WordPress theme.

To start search and replace all references to 'blocktheme' and replace them with the new theme name, also rename the theme folder the same theme name.

The theme is a barebones starter kit which is block theme ready, to start creating:

1. build your parts in the site editor but do not save them in the editor.
2. once you are happy with each part build copy the blocks into the relavant part files, eg; header.html and footer.html.
3. do the same for the index.html templates, eg; build in the editor then copy and paste the blocks into your template file
4. do the same for each template, for example duplicate the index.html and rename it single.html, build, copy and paste into the template file, duplicate single.html and rename it page.html build, copy and paste into the template etc etc.
5. edit the theme.json file with your settings and styles as you design the theme.

NOTE: only the index.html template is included in this theme as a starting point, when you are happy with the edited all the parts/templates you'll have a finished theme ready for distribution, ensure to copy the blocks from the editor rather than save them, copy and paste the relavant blocks into each part/template.
Do not save any templates or parts in the site editor as you are building your theme and do not save any global settings or styles in site editor otherwise these will override your theme settings and styles as set in your theme.json file.
